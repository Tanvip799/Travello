## Features

### **Natural Language Voice Input**
Users can input complex, multi-stop travel plans through voice. Speech is transcribed using **OpenAI Whisper**, allowing for flexible, conversational inputs.  
**Example:**  
_"I want to go from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology to TSG Sports Arena in Borivali, and then towards Greeshma Residency in Thane. On the way to TSG, I want to stop at a library. While heading home from TSG, I want to stop for petrol."_

### **NLP-Powered Intent Extraction**
The transcribed text is processed using **Gemini** to extract:
- The ordered sequence of main destinations.
- Intermediate preferences, such as specific stopovers.
- Categorization of each location as **Primary destination** or **Auxiliary Point of Interest (POI)** (e.g., petrol pump, library).

The output is structured into a clean **JSON format** for further processing.

### **Multimodal Route Generation (Car and Public Transit)**
- If the user selects **car**, routes are computed using **Ola Maps Directions API**.
- If the user prefers **public transit**, routes are generated using **OpenTripPlanner**, backed by manually compiled GTFS data (supports metro, bus, and train schedules).
- The system can **dynamically reprocess the route** if preferences change.

### **Dynamic Point of Interest (POI) Integration and Rerouting**
- For each auxiliary stop (e.g., petrol, library), nearby suggestions are fetched using **Ola Maps Places API**.
- The user can select from these suggestions.
- The route is then automatically recalculated based on the selected POIs and overall path logic.

### **In-App Public Transit Ticket Booking**
- If the final journey involves public transport, users can directly book their ticket **within the app**.
- The booking process utilizes **Google Pay deep linking**, allowing a smooth transition from route planning to booking.
